what is sha ?

ðŸ§  When Is It Generated?
Every time you make a commit in Git, Git generates a SHA hash for that commit.
This hash is based on the contents of the commit (files, metadata, etc.).
Itâ€™s created automatically by Git, not by GitHub Actions.


 What Is run_id?
Itâ€™s a numeric ID automatically generated by GitHub every time a workflow runs.
It uniquely identifies that specific execution of your workflow.

 When Is It Generated?
Itâ€™s created at the moment your workflow is triggered, whether by a push, pull_request, schedule, or manual dispatch.
Each run gets a new run_id, even if it's for the same workflow file.
